<p>LuaJava is a scripting tool for Java. The goal of this tool is to allow scripts written in Lua to manipulate components developed in Java.</p>

<p>
LuaJava allows Java components to be accessed from Lua using the same syntax 
that is used for accessing Lua`s native objects, without any need for 
declarations or any kind of preprocessing.
For this check <a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/luajava/manual.html">LuaJava's Lua Reference</a>.
</p>

<p>
LuaJava also allows Java to implement an interface using Lua.
This way any interface can be implemented in Lua and passed as parameter to 
any method, and when called, the equivalent function will be called in Lua, 
and it's result passed back to Java.
